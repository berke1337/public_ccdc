# Password Sheet

We have one central password sheet with pre-generated passwords. If somebody
yells "password sheet", look if it is near you and if so give it to the person.
The password sheet looks like this:

Password     | Username | Service | Host
-------------| -------- | ------- | ----
UaPsf7a80sf0 | root     | login   | foo
YExOW72hdfq  | root     | mysql   | bar
...          | ...      | ...     | ...

### In the first 20 minutes

In the first 20 minutes, having one password sheet will be too busy because
everybody is changing passwords. Hence, we have a local password sheet for every
machine which we use in the first 20 minutes. When things get somewhat calm
again, we probably want to change all passwords again, and then we just use a
new unified password sheet.
