# Tomcat Hardening

Apache Tomcat is a Java based web-server.

In most default installations, Tomcat includes a "manager" application, which
allows uploading arbitrary JARs to run on the server (e.g. a web shell).

## Securing Tomcat

* Check if the host-manager and manager applications are running.
    * By default the URLs are `/manager` and `/host-manager`
    * To disable these managers
        * Move or change the extension of
          `/etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost/{host-manager.xml,manager.xml}`
    * If you need to keep these managers running, check the credentials for the
      users with access to them in `/etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml`

* Tomcat uses a port (defaults to 8005) as a remote shutdown port.
  * Make sure this port is firewalled.
  * Disable it by changing shutdown port to `-1` in `/etc/tomcat7/server.xml`.
